  the one in the sibling project gddickinson/coffee_explorer (SHA-256 of `ne_110m_land.json`

  the public domain" (https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/). No permission or attribution is required;
  credited here anyway: "Made with Natural Earth."
- **Changes:** converted by `scripts/convert_natural_earth.py` to a compact JSON list of polygons
  (`[outer ring, *hole rings]`, each a list of `[lon, lat]`), coordinates rounded to 0.01 degree, consecutive
  duplicate points removed. 127 polygons, 5129 points, about 77 kB.
- **Used by:** `world_shapes.py` -> the web map of tea and herb regions (`/api/world`, `web/static/regions.js`).
  The desktop Map tab still uses `world_map_bg.png`.
