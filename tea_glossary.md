# Tea Terminology Glossary

## Tea Types & Processing

**Camellia sinensis**
The tea plant. All true teas (white, green, oolong, black, pu-erh, yellow) come from this plant.

**Camellia sinensis var. sinensis**
Chinese tea plant variety. Smaller leaves, more cold-hardy. Produces more delicate teas.

**Camellia sinensis var. assamica**
Assam tea plant variety. Larger leaves, tropical climate. Produces robust, malty teas.

**Oxidation**
The enzymatic browning of tea leaves when exposed to air. Key factor in tea processing that determines tea type.

**Withering**
First step in tea processing where leaves lose moisture and become pliable.

**Rolling**
Shaping tea leaves and breaking cell walls to release enzymes for oxidation.

**Firing/Fixing**
Heating tea leaves to stop oxidation and preserve desired characteristics.

**Fermentation**
In tea: either enzymatic oxidation (black tea) or microbial fermentation (pu-erh).

## Tea Categories

**White Tea**
Minimally processed tea, made from young buds and leaves. Low oxidation (5-10%).

**Green Tea**
Unoxidized tea. Leaves are heated soon after picking to prevent oxidation.

**Yellow Tea**
Rare tea with slight oxidation (10-20%). Undergoes slow drying/yellowing process.

**Oolong Tea**
Partially oxidized tea (12-85%). Complex processing creates unique flavor profiles.

**Black Tea**
Fully oxidized tea (90-100%). Called "red tea" (hongcha) in China.

**Pu-erh Tea**
Post-fermented tea from Yunnan. Can be raw (sheng) or ripe (shou).

**Dark Tea**
Category of post-fermented teas including pu-erh, Liu Bao, and others.

## Brewing Terms

**Steeping**
Immersing tea leaves in hot water to extract flavors and compounds.

**Infusion**

**Reinfusion/Resteepin**
Brewing the same tea leaves multiple times, common with oolong and pu-erh.

**Gongfu Brewing**
Traditional Chinese method using small teapot, many short infusions with high leaf-to-water ratio.

**Western Brewing**
Common Western method using lower leaf ratio, longer steeping times, fewer infusions.

**Flash Rinse**
Quick initial rinse of tea leaves (5-10 seconds) to "wake up" the tea and remove dust.

**Water Temperature**
Critical factor in brewing. Different teas require different temperatures (60-100°C).

## Tea Components

**Plucking Standard**
Which leaves are picked. "One bud two leaves" is common quality standard.

**Orthodox Processing**
